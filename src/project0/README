README file

This directory contains skeleton code for your Project 0 hash table implementation.

The interface is defined in the hash_table.h file. See the hash_table.c file for expected behavior and parameter descriptions.

 You should implement this interface within the hash_table.c file.

main.c is meant for you to run your code as you program to test it. Compile and run the code in main.c by running the following commands in the command line:

make main; ./main

Once your implementation for the put, get and erase functions is complete, you can test their correctness by running our script test.c. Compile and run is through the commands:

make test; ./test

To benchmark your code to determine how efficient your implementation is, run the benchmark:

make benchmark; ./benchmark

To build everything, you can just type:

make
